# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone
## A case study on the cyclistic data set
An analysis completed for the final project of the Coursera course for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate is contained in this repository. In this case study, I attempted to identify and comprehend the key distinctions between annual members and casual riders using data from a hypothetical Chicago-based bike rental firm called Cyclist. With the help of these insights, I was able to provide recommendations that the business used to create a marketing campaign that will maximise its growth by turning casual riders into annual members.
